Welcome to our legacy turn-based game project! Developed by three classmates as a final project, this version of the game is in a legacy state, potentially containing outdated dependencies and practices. However, we have plans for future modernization, including updating dependencies, enhancing gameplay, and improving performance. Stay tuned for the modernized version! Feel free to explore the code, but please note that it may not reflect current best practices in software development.
